# TinyGame
A game designed to be small, yet still qualify as a game

This game was created for an intro to computer games class. The aim of the project was to quickly brainstorm and create a game in Unity that would still meet instructor set requirements while being as stripped down as possible.

To view the project in Unity, paste the Assets, Packages, and ProjectSettings folders into a Unity 2019.2.17f1 project
